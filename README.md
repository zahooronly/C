# Introduction to System Programming with C

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is System Programming?

- System programming is the activity of programming computer system software. The primary distinguishing characteristic of systems programming when compared to application programming is that application programming aims to produce software which provides services to the user directly (e.g. word processor), whereas systems programming aims to produce software and software platforms which provide services to other software, are performance constrained, or both (e.g. operating systems, computational science applications, game engines and AAA video games, industrial automation, and software as a service applications).
- System programming requires a great degree of hardware awareness. Its goal is to achieve efficient use of available resources, either because the software itself is performance critical (AAA video games) or because even small efficiency improvements directly transform into significant monetary savings for the service provider (cloud based word processors).
- Examples of system programming include operating systems, computational science software, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications.

### 1.2. What is C?

- C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
- C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.

### 1.3. Why C?

- C is a general-purpose programming language used for wide range of applications from Operating systems like Windows and iOS to software that is used for creating 3D movies. C programming is highly efficient. That’s the main reason why it’s very popular despite being more than 40 years old. Standard C programs are portable. The source code written in one system works in another operating system without any change.
- C is highly portable. This means that C programs written for one computer can be run on another with little or no modification. C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.
- C is case-sensitive. C is highly portable. This means that C programs written for one computer can be run on another with little or no modification. C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.
- C is case-sensitive. C provides various data types and each data type is represented differently within the computer’s memory. C language supports 32 keywords, some predefined functions which are available to use in program and we can also create our own functions. C language also allows the user to define various types of variables or constants and also their scope (local and global) and lifetime (static and dynamic).

### 1.4. What is a compiler?

- A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.

### 1.5. What is a linker?

- A linker or link editor is a computer system program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another object file.

### 1.6. What is a library?

- In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications. In IBM's OS/360 and its successors they are referred to as partitioned data sets.

### 1.7. What is a header file?

- A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions (see Macros) to be shared between several source files. You request the use of a header file in your program by including it, with the C preprocessing directive ‘#include’.
- The C programming language provides many standard library functions for file input and output. These functions make up the bulk of the C standard library header <stdio.h>. The functionality descends from a "portable I/O package" written by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, and officially became part of the Unix operating system in Version 7.

### 1.8. What is a Makefile?

- A makefile is a file (by default named "Makefile") containing a set of directives used by a make build automation tool to generate a target/goal. A makefile is typically used to build executable programs and libraries from source code.

### 1.9. What is a shell?

- A shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.

### 1.10. What is a terminal?

- A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system. The teletype was an example of an early day hardcopy terminal, and predated the use of a computer screen by decades.

## Advance Concepts in C

### 2.1. What is a pointer?

- A pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page. The actual format and content of a pointer variable is dependent on the underlying computer architecture.

### 2.2. What is a function pointer?

- A function pointer, also called a subroutine pointer or procedure pointer, is a pointer that points to a function. As opposed to referring directly to the data value, a function pointer points to the memory address where the function code starts. Function pointers can be used to simplify code by providing a simple way to select a function to execute based on run-time values. They can also be used to implement callbacks and to facilitate event handling or state machine programming.

### 2.3. What is a structure?

- A structure is a user defined data type in C/C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. Structure helps to construct a complex data type which is more meaningful. It is somewhat similar to an Array, but an array holds data of similar type only. But structure on the other hand, can store data of any type. Structure is used to represent a record.

### 2.4. What is a union?

- A union is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.

### 2.5. What is a bit field?

- A bit field is a data structure used in computer programming. It consists of a number of adjacent computer memory locations which have been allocated to hold a sequence of bits, stored so that any single bit or group of bits within the set can be addressed. A bit field is most commonly used to represent integral types of known, fixed bit-width.

### 2.6. What is a typedef?

- The typedef keyword creates a type definition that simplifies code and makes a program easier to read. The C programming language allows programmers to define their own types using the typedef keyword. The typedef keyword creates a synonym for an existing type, and is sometimes used to provide abstraction from the machine implementation in C programs.

### 2.7. What is a enum?

- An enumerated type is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type. The enumerator names are usually identifiers that behave as constants in the language. A variable that has been declared as having an enumerated type can be assigned any of the enumerators as a value.

### 2.8. What is a macro?

- A macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro. There are two kinds of macros. They differ mostly in what they look like when they are used. Object-like macros resemble data objects when used, function-like macros resemble function calls.

### 2.9. What is a preprocessor?

- In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program. The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages.

### 2.10. What is a header guard?

- Header guards (also known as include guards, header files, or conditional includes) are a programming technique in C/C++ used to prevent the contents of a header file from being included multiple times. Header guards are typically used in conjunction with #include directives.

## 3. C Programming Language

### 3.1. What is a variable?

- A variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name (an identifier) which contains some known or unknown quantity or information, a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.
